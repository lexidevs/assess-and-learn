### LLM Disclosure

Large language models, in particular models served through GitHub Copilot, were used to create some limited portions of the initial code for this project. All code written by LLMs has been reviewed in detail by humans, and probably rewritten. 

Similarly, GitHub Copilot has been used to draft commit messages for some commits. 

No image generation features have, or will be used in the creation of this project. All usage of generative "AI" will be disclosed.
